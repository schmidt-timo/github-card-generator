# About

This app creates beautiful info cards for GitHub repositories. I used Next.js and React components such as styled-components. MongoDB serves as its database.

## GitHub Card Generator

You'll need to fill out the following data:
1. User name (Repository owner)
2. Repository name
3. Select a color
4. Select one of the icons

## GitHub Cards

You'll then get a link for a GitHub Card of this repository where you can find information such as:
- Repository owner
- Repository title
- Repository description
- Selected color and icon
- Top 10 contributors
- Buttons and counter for Fork/Star
